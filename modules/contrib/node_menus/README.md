Use case
========
Drupal allows to add node link into menu which is okay,
if you have one menu and/or few links. When you build a site with
multilingual features and create a menu per language,
then your select box might grow really long. This module tries to help with
this use case.

Installation
============
* Enable module
* Add two or more languages
* Create menu for each language
* Configure content type(s) to be translatable and check Language menus setting to select enabled menus per language.

Additional notes
================
Functionality works with and without language selector on the node edit page.
If language selector is available on the edit page, selecting language will change menu parent options.
